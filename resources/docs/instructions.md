1.
I want you to document one of our customers themes. use 'wp-content/plugins/lbwp/resources/docs/s03-theme-dev.md' as documentation on how we develop our themes.
In wp-content/plugins/lbwp/resources/docs/themes/forfuture.md add a documentation on all JS,PHP and SCSS files in the theme 'wp-content/themes/forfuture-s03'.
only document files ending in .php, .js and .scss. - also structure it by main folders src, assets, views.
the purpose of this documentation is not for us, but for you if you need reference
how we did things in the past when your task is do develop a new theme -it should serve a reference of "how to do things".
whenever you will get the task to develop new themes for us, you can use this as reference, to see if we did something already,
so you can sneek peek at our code and maybe find some inspiration.
